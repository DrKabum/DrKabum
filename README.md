### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicolas Broca, a former nurse that wants to become a dev

I'm new in the dev industry. I've been looking for a career change after 10 years as a nurse, with a very exciting career as a paramedic (or kind of, in France it's a bit different, but it's very similar) and in an international NGO. I've been programming on small projects during all that time too, I even created an app to manage disaster victims!

Now, I'm in the process of moving to Australia and I feel like it's time to change my career to become a pro developer. I've trained hard in front-end web development, but I also enjoy a lot backend and I'm skilling up with Python too.

I love HTML/CSS, JavaScript and React!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicolas Broca, Software and DevSecOps engineer
I am javascript and python developer and I have been working in DevSecOps since 2022. I can build things with NodeJS, Bun, ExpressJS, React, NextJS, HTML and CSS and I can automate a whole lot of stuff using those languages, GitHub actions, Azure DevOps and many other things.

I've also worked as a nurse/paramedic for 10 years before that, on land and on sea and as a field worker for humanitarian NGOs. I know the value of teamwork, constant learning, and how impactful open source and accessible tech can be in even the most unexpected places. This also taught me to manage pressure and think out of the box.

Feel free to contact me ðŸ˜‰

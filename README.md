### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicolas Broca, Software and DevSecOps engineer
I am a javascript and python developer and I have been working in DevSecOps since 2022. I can build things with NodeJS, Bun, ExpressJS, React, NextJS, HTML and CSS and I can automate a whole lot of stuff using those languages, GitHub actions, Azure DevOps and many other things. I also love to experiment and have fun with code, which I often do by making Discord bots and games with JS or Godot.

I've also worked as a nurse/paramedic for 10 years before that, on land, on sea or in the air and as a field worker for humanitarian NGOs. I know the value of teamwork, constant learning, and how impactful tech can be in even the most unexpected places, especially if they are open source and accessible. This also taught me how to manage pressure and think out of the box.

Feel free to contact me ðŸ˜‰
